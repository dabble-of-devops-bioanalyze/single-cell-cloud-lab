      Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data built jointly with anndata. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference and differential expression testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with datasets of more than one million cells.

# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Open-source **[Cloud Lab](https://www..bioanalyze.io)** for Single Cell Analysis.


# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-

  - Cloud Native - Browse an S3 bucket and view your Single Cell data in [CellxGene](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene).
  - Authentication enabled through [Flask AppBuilder](https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html) in the standalone version or [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/documentation/configuration/) in the hosted version.
  - Open source - Nothing is hidden behind a paywall.
  - Self hosted and hosted with the AWS Marketplace (Coming Soon!) option.
  - Download your PCA, TSNE, or UMAP plots for any dataset.

  **Choose your Datasets from S3**

  ![Select S3 Datasets](./apps/static/select-s3-dataset.png)

  **Plot Views**

  Plot your PCA, Umap, and/or TSNE with gene names or other observations.

  ![PCA Histogram](./apps/static/sc_pca_hist.png)
  ![PCA Scatterplot](./apps/static/sc_pca_scatter.png)

  **DataTable Views**

  View, sort, filter and export your ScanPy dataframes.

  **CellxGene**

  [CellxGene](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene) is *an interactive explorer for single-cell transcriptomics data*.

  Please note that I did not write CellXGene. Cellxgene is developed by the lovely folks over at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiave.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  ## ✨ Quick Start Self Hosted in `Docker`

  > Get the code

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dabble-of-devops-bioanalyze/single-cell-cloud-lab
  cd single-cell-cloud-lab
  cp .env.sample .env
  ```

  > Add your env vars

  At a minimum you'll need AWS credentials and the S3 bucket where your scanpy datasets are stored.

  ```
  SECRET_KEY=S3cr3t_K#Key
  CELLXGENE_BUCKET="my-s3-bucket"
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="1234"
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="abcd"
  AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
  SYNC_ENABLED=True
  # View without authentication
  PUBLIC=True
  ```

  If you have the `PUBLIC=True` in your env file you won't need to configure any authentication.

  To configure authentication open the `config.py` and make any necessary changes.

  > Start the app in Docker

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

  Visit `http://localhost:5005` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

  ## ✨ Quick Start  - AWS Marketplace

  Coming Soon!
